# Track Shipments Bot

This is a personal project I created to automate the process of tracking the current status of shipments from major international container shipping lines

## Objective

The primary objective of this project was to automate and streamline the daily task of updating the current status of various containers that are currently in transit.

## Solution

The bot uses the Node.js library Puppeteer for web scraping information from multiple shipping line websites. It stores this information in a non-relational database, MongoDB, using an API and displays the current shipments using React and Chakra UI.   

By automating the shipment tracking process and web scrapping the websites on a daily basis, it has allowed me to save time and avoid the cumbersome task of tracking all shipments and its current status.
